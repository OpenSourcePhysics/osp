Site resources directory

This directory can be used to hold files that programs within this Eclipse project 
need to run -- data files or images embedded within the site's html pages, for instance. Files in it will be copied to 
the site by build-site.xml.

The default location for the SwingJS JavaScript library is: ./site.

Note that the SwingJS JavaScript library is a subdirectory within the site.
