 * Title:        Measurable
 * Description:  A Measurable object returns only positive min and max values for its x and y extent.
 * This interface is used to autoscale the x and y axes on a drawing panel.
 *
 * Minimum and maximum values may NOT be valid if isMeasured returns false.  Objects that
 * store data, for example, usually return zero if data is null.
