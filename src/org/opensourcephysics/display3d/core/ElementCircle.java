 * <p>Title: ElementSegment</p>
 * <p>Description: Draws a circle at its position with the given size.
 * The default size is zero (which draws a point).</p>
 * Because a circle is essentialy a 2D object, it doesn't behave completely
 * as a 3D object. Thus, its center will be affected by transformations
 * of the element, BUT ITS SIZE WON'T. Moreover, in 3D visualizations, the
 * maximum of sizeX and sizeY is used for its horizontal size. In all other
 * views, the corresponding size is used.
