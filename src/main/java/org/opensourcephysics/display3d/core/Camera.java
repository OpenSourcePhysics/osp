/**
 * <p>Title: Camera</p>
 * <p>Description: This class provides access to the position of the camera,
 * its focus point and its distance to the projection screen that are used
 * to view the 3D scenes. The camera can also be rotated around the line
 * of sight (i.e. the line which conects the camera with the focus point).</p>
 * <p>The camera position can be set using either the desired X,Y,Z coordinates
 * or spherical coordinates around the focus point. This makes it
 * easy to rotate the scene both horizontally and vertically (around the focus).</p>
 * <p>Panning can be achieved by moving the focus point to one side.</p>
 * <p>Zooming is done increasing (positive zoom) or decreasing the distance
 * between the camera and the projection screen.</p>
 * <p> The projection screen is always normal to the line of sight and has
 * its origin at the intersection of this line with the screen itself.</p>
 * <p>The camera provides fives different modes of projecting points in space
 * to the screen. Two modes are truly three-dimensional. The other three are
 * planar modes.
