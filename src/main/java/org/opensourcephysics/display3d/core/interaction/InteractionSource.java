 * an interaction event.</p>
 * <p>Classes implementing this class should document what targets
 * the contain.</p>
 * <p>Classes implementing the InteractionListener interface can register
 * to receive interaction events using the <code>addInteractionListener</code>
 * method of this interface.</p>
