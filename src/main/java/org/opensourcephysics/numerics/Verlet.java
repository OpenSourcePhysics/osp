/**
 * Verlet:  A velocity Verlet method ODE solver.
 *
 * The velocity Verlet algorithm is a self-starting equivalent of the Verlet algorithm.
 * It assumes a constant acceleration to estimate the final position
 * and an average accleration to estimate the final velocity.
 * The position is first updated, the force is calcualted at the new position,
 * and then the velocity is updated.
 *
 * x(n+1) = x(n) + v(n)* dt + a(n)*dt*dt/2
 * a_est=F(x(n+1),v(n),t)/m
 * v(n+1) = v(n) + (a(n)+a_est)*dt/2
 *
 * CAUTION! This implementation assumes that the state variables alternate
 * between position and velocity with the last variable being time.
 * That is, the  state vector is ordered as follows:
 *
 * x1, d x1/dt, x2, d x2/dt, x3, d x3/dt ..... xN, d xN/dt, t
 *

   * Gets the counter that records the number of times the rate has been evaluated during the current step.
   *
   * This method allows a model to improve its performance
   * by enabling the model to determine if this is the first or second time that the rate is being evaluated.
   * The Verlet algorithm first invokes the model's getRate method to update the position and
   * then again to update velocity.  Because the force at the new position is computed the
   * second time that getRate is invoked, a model can improve its performance if it skips the force computation
   * during the first call to getRate.
   *
   * A typical dynamics simulation should comptute the force when rateCounter is one and stores this force
   * for use during the next postion update.
   *
   * The Verlet algorithm will perform correctly (but more slowly) if the
   * force is computed every time that getRate is invoked.
