SwingJS distribution -- resources directory

This directory can be used to hold files that code within this Eclipse project 
needs to run -- data files, for instance. Files in it will be copied to 
the SwingJS JavaScript library within the site by build-site.xml.

The default location for the SwingJS library is: ./site/swingjs/j2s.
